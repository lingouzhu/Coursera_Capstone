# Australian Shopping Centres
In Australia, online shopping is devastating retail. In 2018 alone, the number of online purchases grew by more than 13% year on year in every State and Territory. While Australia’s major metro cities still dominate online purchasing, there is also rapid growth in online shopping in regional areas. Even in remote areas of Australia, it’s clear that the households that shop online are doing more frequently and they are buying a wider variety of products.

Foot traffic in physical stores has continously fallen. Physical stores have to create compelling reasons for customers to leave their homes and go shopping.

Some shopping centre operators are responsing by expanding their offerrings of food, events and shopping experiences. For example, the redevelopment of the Chadstone shopping centre in Victoria included a new dine-in restaurant precinct, and movie theatre and a Lego Discovery Centre.

This study explores physical retail shops in shopping centres across Australia, to discover what types of physical shops are popular and pickup by customers. Futhermore, it is also interesting to understand if types of physical shops are different across Australia.
